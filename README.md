- CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE
- It is the monetary value that a customer brings to a company over the course of a relationship with that company. 
  If we can determine the value that our customers can provide us in the future, we can organize our relationships 
  with our customers and as a company, we can exhibit a more value-added approach in the customer-oriented medium and long term. 
  Calculating this value will also play an important role in determining the budgets to be allocated in the field of marketing activities. 
  If we know this value CLTV, if we know the current customer value, if we calculate the cost to be spent to gain new customers, we can compare the cost 
  required to gain new customers with the existing ones and we can take a healthier approach.
- Customer Lifetime Value Calculation
- Since this calculated value does not have a time projection aspect, it does not allow us to make a forward-looking  prediction. However, it will be a very 
  valuable study in terms of determining the values of existing customers.
- Road Map
  - 1. Data Preparation
  - 2. Average Order Value (average_order_value = total_price / total_transaction)
  - 3. Purchase Frequency (total_transaction / total_number_of_customers)
  - 4. Repeat Rate & Churn Rate (number of customers making more than one purchase / all customers)
  - 5. Profit Margin (profit_margin = total_price * 0.10)
  - 6. Customer Value (customer_value = average_order_value * purchase_frequency)
  - 7. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV = (customer_value / churn_rate) x profit_margin)
  - 8. Creation of Segments
